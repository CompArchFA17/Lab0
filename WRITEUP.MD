### Taylor Sheneman and Alexander Hoppe

## Introduction
In this lab exercise, we used Alex's full adder implementation from HW2 to make a 4-bit adder. To do this we chained together four full adder modules, carry-out to carry-in. We then ran a simulated test bench as well as testing on a Xilinx ZYBO FPGA dev kit.
